# Upgrading to Serverless Framework v3

Serverless Framework v3 contains a few breaking changes that may impact some projects.

This guide helps users upgrade from Serverless Framework v2 to v3.

**Note:** Serverless Framework v3 isn't released yet. However, this guide helps to prepare to v3, or upgrade to the [v3 beta version](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-framework-v3-beta).

## Am I impacted by breaking changes?

Serverless Framework v2 signals any deprecated feature via a deprecation warning. The simplest way to upgrade to v3 is to:

1. Upgrade Serverless Framework to the latest v2 version
2. Run `serverless` commands in the project to see if there are any deprecation warnings

Projects that do not have any deprecations can be immediately upgraded to v3. Projects that have deprecation warnings should first solve these deprecations, then upgrade to v3.

## What about plugins?

We have worked with the most popular plugins to make sure they support Serverless Framework v3. As long as a project has no deprecations, it can be safely upgraded to v3.

That being said, some plugins need to be updated to be installable with v3. In most cases, it is a matter of allowing the plugin to be installed with Serverless Framework v3 in `package.json` (updating the `peerDependencies` requirement). Feel free to open an issue or pull request in the GitHub repository of the plugin.

## Upgrading to v3

First, upgrade to the latest v2 version and make sure that you do not see any deprecation warning.

Then, to upgrade to Serverless Framework v3, run:

```bash
npm update -g serverless
```

**Note:** v3 is currently available as beta version. [Read the blog post](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-framework-v3-beta) to upgrade to v3 beta until the stable version is released.

If you [installed `serverless` as a standalone binary](../getting-started.md#install-as-a-standalone-binary), run the following command instead:

- MacOS/Linux standalone binary: `serverless upgrade --major`
- Windows: `choco upgrade serverless`

## Using v2 and v3 in different projects

It is possible to use v3 in some projects and v2 in other projects. To achieve that, install the Serverless Framework locally via NPM (`npm i --save-dev serverless`).

There are 2 scenarios:

- Using v3 globally, and v2 in specific projects.

  This is the simplest. Upgrade the global version to v3, and install v2 in specific projects (via NPM). The `serverless` command will automatically run the correct version (v3 can run v2).

- Using v2 globally, and v3 in specific projects.

  To achieve that, install v3 in specific projects (via NPM). Then, use `serverless` for v2 projects, and `npx serverless` for v3 projects.

## Breaking changes

You will find below a complete list of all breaking changes. All those breaking changes were signaled via deprecation messages in Serverless Framework v2.

### CLI commands and options

The `serverless` CLI no longer runs on Node v10 because [that version is obsolete](https://endoflife.date/nodejs): upgrade to v12 or greater to run `serverless` on your machine.

The `serverless` CLI used to accept free-form CLI options. This feature was deprecated and has been removed. The main reason is that this prevented us from detecting typos in options, which sometimes created unexpected situations and overall a bad user experience. [Learn more about this change](../deprecations.md#handling-of-unrecognized-cli-options).

Additionally, all CLI options must now be passed at the end of the commands:

```bash
# Will no longer work in v3:
serverless --verbose deploy

# Correct syntax:
serverless deploy --verbose
```

This change makes the CLI much more robust at detecting arguments from options and their values.

On that note, the `-v` option is no longer recognized (it was ambiguous with `--version`): use the full `--verbose` option instead.

When the `serverless` CLI is installed globally and locally (in the projectâ€™s `node_modules`), the local version will always be used. It is no longer possible to disable that behavior ([learn more](../deprecations.md#support-for-enablelocalinstallationfallback-setting-is-to-be-removed)).

Finally, the `serverless studio` command has been removed: that feature was deprecated and is no longer available.

### Service configuration

The default Lambda runtime has changed from NodeJS 12 to NodeJS 14, given this is now the default runtime recommended by AWS.

Additionally, the `nodejs10.x`, `python2.7`, `ruby2.5` and `dotnetcore2.1` runtimes [are no longer supported and accepted by AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtime-support-policy.html). As such, these runtimes will no longer be accepted in v3.

In `serverless.yml`, the `service` key no longer accepts a YAML object ([learn more](../deprecations.md#service-property-object-notation)).

```yaml
# Deprecated in v2, removed in v3:
service:
    name: my-service

# Correct syntax:
service: my-service
```

All options that used to be defined inside the `service` key have been moved to other sections (mentioned below in that document). This change clears up confusion that existed between the `service` and `provider` sections.

### API Gateway

When configuring API Gateway, some configuration options have moved to a dedicated sub-section of `provider`. That will help clear up confusion with similar `httpApi` settings.

```yaml
provider:
  # Deprecated in v2, removed in v3:
  apiKeys: ...
  resourcePolicy: ...
  usagePlan: ...

  # Correct syntax:
  apiGateway:
    apiKeys: ...
    resourcePolicy: ...
    usagePlan: ...
```

The `schema` option on HTTP events has also been renamed to `schemas`. That change allowed us to support much more schema validation features:

```yaml
functions:
  hello:
    handler: hello.handler
    events:
      - http:
          ...
          request:
            # Deprecated in v2, removed in v3:
            schema: ...
            # Correct syntax:
            schemas: ...
```

Learn more about [schema changes](../deprecations.md#aws-api-gateway-schemas).

When an external API Gateway is used and imported via `provider.apiGateway.restApiId`, both `provider.logs.restApi` and `provider.tracing.apiGateway` options are ignored. In v3, an error will be thrown if these options are defined. Indeed, these settings are applicable only if the API Gateway is provisioned by Serverless Framework.

The CloudFormation tags defined in `provider.tags` will now be correctly applied to HTTP APIs stages ([learn more](../deprecations.md#http-api-provider-tags)).

Starting with v3, AWS's recommended behavior for API Gateway authorizers will become the default: `functions[].events[].http.authorizer.identitySource` will no longer be set to `method.request.header.Authorization` by default when caching is disabled (i.e. for authorizers of type "request" with `resultTtlInSeconds` set to "0") ([learn more](../deprecations.md#default-identitysource-for-httpauthorizer)).

### CloudFront

Some CloudFront `behavior` options where deprecated by AWS: ForwardedValues, MinTTL, MaxTTL and DefaultTTL. These options have been removed. Use the new ["cache policy" feature](../providers/aws/events/cloudfront.md#cache-policy-configuration) instead ([learn more](../deprecations.md#cloudfront-event-behaviorforwardedvalues-property)).

### EventBridge

By default, all EventBridge resources (including Lambda triggers) will now be deployed using native CloudFormation resources, instead of a custom resource ([learn more](../deprecations.md#aws-eventbridge-lambda-event-triggers)). The change has the benefit of relying on native AWS features now, which will be more stable and future-proof.

Since this is a hard breaking change for Serverless Framework v2 users, it is possible to keep the legacy behavior (based on custom resources) by using this flag:

```yaml
provider:
  eventBridge:
    useCloudFormation: false
```

With this flag, v2 users can upgrade to v3 without breaking change. Note that `useCloudFormation: false` will be deprecated eventually, and will not be supported in the future.

### KMS

When configuring KMS keys, some configuration options have moved ([learn more](../deprecations.md#awskmskeyarn-references)):

```yaml
# Deprecated in v2, removed in v3:
service:
  awsKmsKeyArn: ...
functions:
  hello:
    awsKmsKeyArn: ...

# Correct syntax:
provider:
  kmsKeyArn: ...
functions:
  hello:
    kmsKeyArn: ...
```

That allowed us to make the KMS configuration consistent with all other AWS resources: these are now configured in the `provider` section.

### Alexa skill

`alexaSkill` events now require an `appId` ([learn more](../deprecations.md#support-for-alexaskill-event-without-appid-is-to-be-removed)). That change was required to implement a more stable deployment, as well as to deploy more restricted IAM permissions.

### Lambda Hashing Algorithm

By default, Lambda version hashes will now be generated using an improved algorithm (fixes determinism issues). As it is a breaking change that requires more manual effort during migration, it is still possible (but not recommended) to keep using the old algorithm by using the following configuration:

```
provider:
  lambdaHashingVersion: 20200924
```

However, we highly encourage an upgrade to the new algorithm. To upgrade, you must redeploy your service with code or configuration change in all functions. You can do it by following the guide below:

**NOTE**: Please keep in mind that these changes require two deployments with manual configuration adjustment between them. It also creates two additional versions and temporarily overrides descriptions of your functions. Migration will need to be done separately for each of your environments/stages.

1. Run `sls deploy` with additional `--enforce-hash-update` flag: that flag will override the description for Lambda functions, which will force the creation of new versions.
2. Set `provider.lambdaHashingVersion` to `20201221` in your configuration: your service will now always deploy with the new Lambda version hashes (which is the new defualt in v3).
3. Run `sls deploy`, this time without additional `--enforce-hash-update` flag: that will restore the original descriptions on all Lambda functions.

Now your whole service is fully migrated to the new Lambda Hashing Algorithm.

If you do not want to temporarily override descriptions of your functions or would like to avoid creating unnecessary versions of your functions, you might want to use one of the following approaches:

- Ensure that code for all your functions will change during deployment, set `provider.lambdaHashingVersion: 20201221` in your configuration, and run `sls deploy`. Due to the fact that all functions have code changed, all your functions will be migrated to new hashing algorithm. Please note that the change can be caused by e.g. upgrading a dependency used by all your functions so you can pair it with regular chores.
- Add a dummy file that will be included in deployment artifacts for all your functions, set `provider.lambdaHashingVersion: 20201221` in your configuration, and run `sls deploy`. Due to the fact that all functions have code changed, all your functions will be migrated to new hashing algorithm.
- If it is safe in your case (e.g. it's only development sandbox), you can also tear down the whole service by `sls remove`, set `provider.lambdaHashingVersion: 20201221` in your configuration, and run `sls deploy`. Newly recreated environment will be using new hashing algorithm.

### Low-level changes

Internal changes that may impact plugins or advanced use cases:

- Plugins can no longer define custom variables via the legacy variable resolver ([learn more](../deprecations.md#new-variables-resolver)).

  The new variable resolver API was introduced to provide a simpler and more stable way of defining custom variables. Most plugins have switched to that new variable resolver, but older plugins may still require some updates.

- CloudFormation outputs are now always exported ([learn more](../deprecations.md#disable-default-output-export-names)

  This change allows us to simplify and clean up the internals by removing options and logic switches. The use cases for not exporting CloudFormation outputs were very uncommon.

- When using the Serverless Framework programmatically, the service configuration must be at the root directory of the service ([learn more](../deprecations.md#service-configurations-should-not-be-nested-in-service-sub-directories)) and the arguments have changed ([learn more here](../deprecations.md#serverless-constructor-service-configuration-dependency) as well as [here](../deprecations.md#serverless-constructor-configcommands-and-configoptions-requirement)).

  Using the Serverless Framework programmatically is a very unusual and low-level scenario: we took advantage of the major version to improve the API.

### Deprecated features that will be kept in v3

Some Serverless Framework v2 features were marked as deprecated. However, given they are still widely used, we have chosen to keep the following features in v3.

IAM configuration has changed, yet both syntaxes are supported in v3:

```yaml
# Older syntax, still supported in v3
provider:
  role: ...
  rolePermissionsBoundary: ...
  iamRoleStatements: ...
  iamManagedPolicies: ...
  cfnRole: ...

# New syntax
provider:
  iam:
    role:
      name: ...
      permissionsBoundary: ...
      statements: ...
      managedPolicies: ...
    deploymentRole: ...
```

In the same spirit, packaging configuration has changed but both syntaxes are supported in v3:

```yaml
# Older syntax, still supported in v3
package:
  exclude:
    - 'src/**'
  include:
    - src/function/handler.js

# New syntax
package:
  patterns:
    - '!src/**'
    - src/function/handler.js
```

Configuration validation is still kept at the "warning" level by default (instead of turning to errors, as initially planned). To turn validation issues into errors, use:

```yaml
# v2 and v3 both keep the same default behavior: warnings by default
configValidationMode: warn

# Opt-in errors via:
configValidationMode: error
```

Unlike planned initially, loading `.env` files is kept opt-in via `useDotenv: true`.

Additionally, the short form `serverless deploy -f <function>` is still allowed in v3, but `serverless deploy function -f <function>` stays the preferred form.

### Plugins

The [`serverless-dotenv-plugin`](https://github.com/neverendingqs/serverless-dotenv-plugin) is directly impacted by v3. Indeed, for technical reasons the plugin will no longer be able to resolve `${env:xxx}` variables from `.env` files.

However, `.env` files are now natively supported by Serverless Framework v3. Set `useDotenv: true` to use `.env` variables with `${env:xxx}`:

```yaml
useDotenv: true

provider:
  environment:
    FOO: ${env:FOO}
```

The plugin can still be used as usual if you want to automatically import **all** variables from `.env` into functions.

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-dotenv-plugin

provider:
  environment:
    # With the plugin enabled, all variables in .env are automatically imported
```
